The Neural Network Class contains the code for instantiating a Artificial Neural Network based on Evolutionary Training with random mutations.

The use of this framework is done by implementing a training strategy, strictly said by overriding some methods where you send observations (inputs) and receive actions (outputs) and creating a suitable, stable and well designed training environment.

Check the documentation "How to use the Framework.docx" placed inside the folder of the version.<br />
